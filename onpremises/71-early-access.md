# Early access features

You have two options to gain early access to new/in-progress features:

1. Build from source: follow the instructions at [Building from source](/onpremises/building), additionally modifying `EARLY_ACCESS_FEATURES` to `true` in the [Configuration](https://github.com/structurizr/onpremises/blob/main/structurizr-onpremises/src/main/java/com/structurizr/onpremises/util/Configuration.java) class.
2. Use the pre-built early access builds that are available via the [Structurizr Patreon](https://patreon.com/structurizr).
