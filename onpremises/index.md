# Structurizr on-premises

> The Structurizr on-premises installation will not receive any further updates - please migrate to the new consolidated tooling - see [Introducing Structurizr vNext](https://www.patreon.com/posts/146923136) and [server](/server) for details.

The Structurizr on-premises installation is a standalone version of Structurizr that can be run locally on your own infrastructure.
It's a Jakarta EE/Spring 6 web application, packaged as a `.war` file, for deployment into any compatible Jakarta EE server, such as Apache Tomcat 10.
For ease of deployment, by default, all data is stored on the local file system.
