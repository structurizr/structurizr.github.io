Requests for free support via e-mail will be ignored.

## Priority support (paid)

Priority support packages are available to diagnose and resolve issues in a timely manner, in a 3rd line support capacity.
This __excludes__:

- 1st and 2nd line support.
- Performing installation of the software.
- Configuration/integration with your identity provider or data storage.
- Backing up or restoring the software and/or data on your infrastructure.
- Keying, importing, converting, or manipulation of your data.
- Training on the operation and use of the software.
- Any changes made to the software by yourselves or a third party (i.e. you are running a fork of the software).
- Assistance and guidance related to diagramming/documenting your own software (see [Visualising software architecture with the C4 model](https://simonbrown.je/#workshop3) for a 1-day workshop to learn about the C4 model).

Support hours are Monday-Friday, 09:00-17:00 UK time, with the target response time varying based upon the support package.
Support can be done via a combination of GitHub issues, e-mail, and Slack.
We do not provide any support via telephone or video conference.
