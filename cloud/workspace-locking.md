# Workspace locking

To prevent concurrent modifications, Structurizr will place a lock on the workspace when the diagram/DSL editor is opened,
and will remain for 2-3 minutes after the editor is closed. Other users will not be able to open the diagram/DSL
editor while the workspace is locked.
If needed, locks can be cleared immediately using the "Unlock" link on the workspace summary page.

## Notes

- This is a paid cloud service feature.
