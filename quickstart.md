# Quickstart

The two quickest ways to get started with the Structurizr tooling are:

1. The [Structurizr playground](https://playground.structurizr.com) to try the DSL without installing any tooling.
2. Structurizr [local](/local) (see [quickstart](/local/quickstart)) via the pre-built Docker image to create diagrams on your computer.
