# Quickstart

The two quickest ways to get started with the Structurizr tooling are to use the Structurizr DSL ([example](/dsl/example), [tutorial](/dsl/tutorial)) in conjunction with:

1. The [Structurizr playground](https://playground.structurizr.com) to try the DSL without installing any tooling.
2. Structurizr Lite - a pre-built Docker image to create diagrams on your computer; see [Structurizr Lite - Quickstart](/lite/quickstart) for details.
