# Authentication

Authentication can be configured in one of three ways:

- [No authentication](/server/authentication/none) (default)
- [Form-based login, with a fixed username/password](/server/authentication/fixed)
- [Form-based login, with a file-based user store](/server/authentication/file)
- [Single sign-on with your Identity Provider via SAML 2.0](/server/authentication/saml)
