# No authentication

By default, the Structurizr server is configured without authentication, which means that all features are available to anybody who has access to your Structurizr server installation. This is designed for teams who are installing the server in a trusted and open environment.

## Configuration

| Name                | Value |
|------------------------------|----------------|
| `structurizr.authentication` | `none`         |
