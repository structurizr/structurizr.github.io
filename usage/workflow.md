# Recommended workflow

There are many ways in which the Structurizr tooling can be used,
but the simplest and recommended workflow is as follows:

1. Author workspaces locally using a combination of the [Structurizr DSL](/dsl), [Structurizr Lite](/lite) ([quickstart](/lite/quickstart)), and one of the [VS Code/IDE extensions](/community#structurizr-dsl-editor-and-ide-plugins).
2. Store DSL files in version control (e.g. git).
3. Publish workspaces to an [on-premises installation](/onpremises) or the [cloud service](/cloud) via the [Structurizr CLI](/cli) if the diagrams/documentation need to be viewed by a wider audience. This can be done manually or via a CI/CD build pipeline.
