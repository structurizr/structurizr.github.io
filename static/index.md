# Structurizr static site

The Structurizr CLI can export a static site from a JSON or DSL workspace, that can be included into your website or hosted from a simple web server, Amazon Web Services S3 bucket, etc.
It provides a way to render diagrams only (i.e. no documentation or ADRS), with a subset of the features found in Structurizr Lite/on-premises/cloud:

- [Double-click to navigate](/ui/diagrams/navigation)
- Zooming and scrolling (`+`, `-`, and the mouse scroll wheel)
- Diagram key (`i`)
- Tooltips (`t`)
- [Animation](/ui/diagrams/animation) (`,` and `.`)
- Toggle element descriptions (`d`)
- Toggle element metadata (`m`)
- [Quick navigation](/ui/quick-navigation) (`Space`)
- Bookmarkable diagrams
