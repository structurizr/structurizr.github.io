# Structurizr

Structurizr is a "models as code" tool designed for the [C4 model](https://c4model.com) - you write [Structurizr DSL](/dsl) and Structurizr renders diagrams:

- [Structurizr DSL - Example](/dsl/example)
- [Structurizr DSL - Tutorial](/dsl/tutorial)

Visit [playground.structurizr.com](https://playground.structurizr.com) to try Structurizr without installing any tooling.
