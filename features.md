# Features

Here's a summary of the most notable features provided by Structurizr [local](/local) and [server](/server).

> Structurizr is not a traditional "drag and drop" tool and does not provide a way to make architecture diagrams via a UI. See [UI-driven vs "as code"](https://www.patreon.com/posts/151073821) for the rationale behind this.

## Diagrams

- Create multiple diagrams from a single architecture model ([tutorial](/dsl/tutorial)).
- Browser-based [diagram viewer](/server/diagrams/viewer) and [diagram editor](/server/diagrams/editor) (for manual layout), with [double-click to zoom](/server/diagrams/viewer#navigation).
- Support for a wide variety of notation, including [shapes](/server/diagrams/notation#shapes) and [icons](/server/diagrams/notation#icons) - [diagram keys are generated automatically](/server/diagrams/notation#diagram-key).
- Prebuilt [themes](/server/diagrams/themes) with icons from Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform.
- Support for [architectural perspectives](/server/diagrams/perspectives), including [static](/dsl/cookbook/perspectives-static) and [dynamic](/dsl/cookbook/perspectives-dynamic) perspectives.
- Responsive embeddable diagrams via an [interactive iframe](/server/diagrams/iframe-embed) or [static PNG/SVG](/server/diagrams/image-embed). (server only)
- [Alternative visualisations](/server/additional-visualisations) (force-directed graph and tree).

## Documentation

- [Render Markdown/AsciiDoc documentation](/server/documentation) in your web browser.

## Architecture decision records
