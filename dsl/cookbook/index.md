# Structurizr DSL cookbook

This cookbook is a tutorial guide to the Structurizr DSL, an open source tool for creating diagrams as code from
a single consistent model. This cookbook assumes that you're using the diagram renderer provided by the
[Structurizr cloud service](/cloud),
the [Structurizr on-premises installation](/onpremises),
or [Structurizr Lite](/lite).

Please note that some features (e.g. perspectives, element style shapes/icons, etc) may not be supported if you're
using one of the PlantUML/Mermaid/D2/DOT/etc export formats provided by the
[Structurizr CLI](/cli) and the [structurizr-export library](/export).
